# SwaddleSwap
 
#The SwaddleSwap app is a site where parents can rent a swaddle for up to 2 weeks and try them before they buy them. They will be able to go on the site, create an account and complete a sleep quiz. That quiz will suggest 5 swaddles for them to try during the trial period. At the end of the trial period they need to select which swaddles they’d like to return and which swaddles they would like to purchase.

#For the MVP for this project, the user is going to take a 5 question quiz with the following attributes for questions; baby’s size, the climate of the users location, gender of the baby, whether or not baby can roll and where the baby’s arm were in the womb (up or down). These questions will help me power the database to display the appropriate swaddles based on the users question. The user will then choose to check out with the 5 suggested swaddles. During the check out they can either login or sign up for an account. In this site, they cannot checkout as a guest. The account will save their choices and when they login they will be able to see the swaddles they have checked out. It will take a deposit via credit card as well. If I have time, I will also design the return experience but for the MVP, it will only be the check out and login experience for the user. 
#This repository will specifically house the front-end, UI components and pages as well as images.
